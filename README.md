# Project Name

A Guess Who game made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I followed the steps in the project brief and tried to break down the problems in smaller pieces. I learned about arrays and objects, how to use array methods and I also deepened my knowledge about functions and how to manipulate the DOM. After finishing the steps I had some time left to add audio and a timer to the page. If I had more time I would change the styling and maybe add a guess tracker or make it possible to add a player name when starting the game.
